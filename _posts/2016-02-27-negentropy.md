title: Negentropy
---

Negentropy is the spontaneous creation of order. It is at odds with the core dogma of thermodynamics – that entropy is always increasing. This is only true in the bulk: when averaged across the stars. Life is so perfectly unlike ice melting in the hot sun, living things somehow manage to localize order and structure – in tissues of the body; in the cipher of DNA; embodied in the cycle of growing, learning and reproducing. There is a crystalline eternalism to life extending through space-time, a fractal tensegrity structure – robust and rigid, yet supple.

Particle physics seeks to explain the constituent elements of reality; even coveting the theory of everything. As if one who studied the rocks at the bottom of a quarry could learn about the Taj Mahal. But here reductionism so plainly fails. The whole is infinitely more than the sum of its parts.

Artificial Intelligence is upon us – we are now prospecting on the final frontier of human invention. A reproducing, recursively self-improving system is the ultimate expression of negentropy. It will begin as a seed with a silicon husk and binary genome-program then – watered by radiation from our star – will bloom unbounded and incomprehensibly onwards into the future. <i style="color: #6b6b6b; padding-left: .75em" class="fa fa-file"></i>
